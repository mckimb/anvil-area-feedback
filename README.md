# anvil-area-feedback
Scripts used for analysis in  _Weak anvil cloud area feedback suggested by physical and observational constraints_ by Brett A. McKim, Sandrine Bony, and Jean-Louis Dufresne (2024).

### Figures
If one wants to reproduce the figures in the manuscript from scratch, see analysis.py. This will require some reformatting of directory locations and downloading public data (see below) to work. If one wants to quickly reproduce the figures just using the underlying data (from ./plotting_data/), see github_plotting.ipynb or https://nbviewer.org/github/mckimb/anvil-area-feedback/blob/main/github_plotting.ipynb.

### Raw Data
CERES data were obtained from the NASA  Langley  Research Center (https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/). CALIPSO / CLOUDSAT data were obtained from NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center (https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/CALIPSO/CAL_LID_L3_Cloud_Occurrence-Standard-V1-00_V1-00). ERA5 reanalysis data were obtained from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). HadCRUT5 data were obtained from the Met Office Hadley Centre (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/current/download.html).
